# Developers Overview

## Introduction
[Desmos](../README.md) aims to provide developers a platform on which they will be able to create decentralized and censorship-resistant social network applications. To do so, we've implemented a set of transactions that are useful to perform the most common operations related to this world. If you want to know more about the base concepts of a blockchain and understand some key points, please take a look a the [FAQ page](developer-faq.md). 

## Glossary
Before digging into the available transactions, let's clarify the meaning of some terms that we will be using a lot.

* A **post** is a public message that everyone can read on the chain. 
  When creating it you can also specify if it allows to be commented on or not. 

* A **comment** is a post that has been liked to a parent post. 

* A **reaction** is the way that allows users to express a feeling on a specific post. 

* A **profile** contains a series of (personal) data associated to an account that a user can create on the chain.

## Performing transactions 
If you want to know more about performing transactions to change the current chain state, please go to the [*"Performing transactions"* page](perform-transactions.md). 

## Querying data
If you want to know all the REST APIs endpoints and CLI commands available to query the existing chain state and the saved data, please go to the [*"Querying data"* page](query-data.md).
