# Upgrade manager setup
The following guide allows you to setup your Desmos node along with the [`cosmosd`](https://github.com/regen-network/cosmosd) binary to ensure that each time a new on-chain upgrade is required, it is handled properly.

## 1. Setup `desmosd`
If you haven't already, please setup the `desmosd` binary and your validator node. You can do so by following these guides: 

1. [Setup a full node](../../../fullnode/setup.md)
2. [Setup a validator node](../../setup.md)

## 2. Setup `cosmosd`
### Installation
In order to setup properly `cosmosd` you are required to have Go 1.14+ installed on your machine. To make sure you have it, you can execute the following command, checking that the output matches the one provided: 

```shell
$ go version
go version go1.14.5 <os/build>
```

Also, make sure you have `git` installed as well: 

```shell
$ git version
git version 2.25.1
```

Now, we can start the installation process: 

1. Create a folder for the `cosmosd` source files:  
    ```shell
   mkdir ~/cosmosd
   ```
   
2. Clone the `cosmosd` sources inside that folder:  
   ```shell
   cd ~/cosmosd 
   git clone git@github.com:regen-network/cosmosd.git . 
   ``` 
   
3. Build the `cosmosd` binary and install it inside `$GOBIN` to make it accessible everywhere:
   ```shell
   build -o $GOBIN/cosmosd
   ```

Now, you should be able to execute `cosmosd` from everywhere. If everything has been done correctly, this should be the output: 

```shell
$ cosmosd
DAEMON_NAME is not set
```

### Environment setup
Now, we need to properly setup the environmental variables for `cosmosd`. To do so, run: 

```shell
echo 'export DAEMON_NAME=desmosd' >> ~/.profile
echo 'export DAEMON_HOME=$HOME/.desmosd' >> ~/.profile
echo 'export DAEMON_RESTART_AFTER_UPGRADE=on' >> ~/.profile
echo 'export DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=on  >> ~/.profile
source ~/.profile
``` 

This will load the environmental variables into the `~/.profile` file and then refresh the current terminal instance. 

If you want to know more about the set variables, here is a brief description: 

| Variable | Description |
|:-------- | :---------- |
|`DAEMON_HOME` | Location where upgrade binaries should be kept |
|`DAEMON_NAME` | Name of the binary itself |
| `DAEMON_RESTART_AFTER_UPGRADE` | (optional) if set to on it will restart a sub-process with the same args (but new binary) after a successful upgrade. By default, the manager dies afterwards and allows the supervisor to restart it if needed. Note that this will not auto-restart the child if there was an error. |
|`DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES` | (optional) if set to `on` will enable auto-downloading of new binaries |


### Folders setup
In order to work properly, the upgrade manager inside `cosmosd` needs to have a specific folder structure in place:
 
```
- genesis
  - bin
    - desmosd
- upgrades
  - <name>
    - bin
      - desmosd
```
 
In order to create it, please execute the following commands: 

```shell
mkdir -p ~/.desmosd/upgrade_manager/genesis/bin
mkdir -p ~/.desmosd/upgrade_manager/upgrades
```

Now we need to copy the current `desmosd` binary into the `genesis/bin` folder to ensure that `cosmosd` can start the chain properly: 

```shell
cp $GOBIN/desmosd ~/.desmosd/upgrade_manager/genesis/bin
```
