# Migrate version 0.5.1
While updating you software from version `v0.4.0` to `v0.5.1`, if you run a validator you will need to perform some required actions. 

## Validators
Validators need to remember that they will have to execute the `migrate` command during a future chain upgrade. This will be also remembered inside the upgrade procedure guide. 

A part from this, a small state change is required after executing the `migrate` command. Due to a bug back in `v0.2.0`, the current state has three posts that have a parent id of a post which was created after them. To solve this problem, you need to search through the migrated `genesis.json` file and delete the posts having the following ids: 

```

``` 

Once you have done so, you should be able to start the chain properly.
