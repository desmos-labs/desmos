# Migrate version 0.5.1
While updating you software from version `v0.4.0` to `v0.5.1`, you will need to perform some required actions. 

If you do not manage a validator node, please refer only to the ["*Users*" instructions](#users). However, if you do manage one please also read the ["*Validators*" instructions](#validators). Finally, if you are a developer refer also to the ["*Developers*" instructions](#developers)

## Validators
Validators need to remember that they will have to execute the `migrate` command during a future chain upgrade. This will be also remembered inside the upgrade procedure guide. 

A part from this, a small state change is required after executing the `migrate` command. Due to a bug back in `v0.2.0`, the current state has three posts that have a parent id of a post which was created after them. To solve this problem, you need to search through the migrated `genesis.json` file and delete the posts having the following ids: 

```

``` 

Once you have done so, you should be able to start the chain properly.
