# Migrate to version v0.6.x
While updating from version `v0.5.x` to version `v0.6.x`, there are some required actions that need to be performed. 

## Validators
Validators need to remember that they will have to execute the `migrate` command during a future chain upgrade. This will be also remembered inside the upgrade procedure guide. 

A part from this, a small state change is required after executing the `migrate` command. Due to a bug inside the Cosmos SDK (tracked inside [cosmos/cosmos-sdk#6280](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/6280)) the `crisis` module cannot be initiated properly. To fix this, we need to change the exported `app_state` object by adding the following field inside it: 

```json
{
  "app_state": {
    "crisis": {
      "constant_fee": {
        "amount": "1000",
        "denom": "udaric"
      }
    },

    ...
  }
}
```

Once you have done so, you should be able to start the chain properly without running into this problem anymore in the future.
