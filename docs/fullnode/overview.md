# Desmos fullnode overview
A full-node is a program that fully validates transactions and blocks of a blockchain. It is distinct from a light-node that only processes block headers and a small subset of transactions. Running a full-node requires more resources than a light-node but is necessary in order to be a validator. In practice, running a full-node only implies running a non-compromised and up-to-date version of the software with low network latency and without downtime.

Of course, it is possible and encouraged for users to run full-nodes even if they do not plan to be validators.

If you would like to become a **Desmos** validator, you must first run a **Desmos** fullnode. To do so, please refer to the [installation instructions](setup/overview.md).
