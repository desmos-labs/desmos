Desmos is a Proof of Stake blockchain protocol that allows developers to build social networking or social-enable apps.   

Inside this documentation you will find all the instructions in order to:

- Setup a full node and become a Desmos validator earning $DSMs while sustaining the chain;
- Fix commons validators/full-node problems.
- Use Desmos to build a social-network or social-enabled app;

Being thought for developers or sysadmins, you will find that most of the terms are very technical. However, in order for newcomers to get on board easily, we will also provide you with useful links that redirects you to the proper documentation on third party websites.

To get started, use the navigation bar to move through the pages.
