# Setup

:::note Current Testnet  
See the [testnet repo](https://github.com/desmos-labs/morpheus) for information on the latest testnet, 
including the correct version of Desmos to use and details about the genesis file.  
:::

## Validators
:::warning Requires Desmos executable  
To join the public testnet you **must** have [`desmos` installed](../../03-fullnode/02-setup.md).  
:::

To become a testnet validator, the mainnet instructions apply:

1. [Create a full node](../../03-fullnode/02-setup.md).
2. [Become a validator](../../04-validators/02-setup.md)

The only difference is the Desmos software version and genesis file. See the [testnet repo](https://github.com/desmos-labs/morpheus) for information on testnets, including the correct version of Desmos to use and details about the genesis file.
